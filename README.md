Submit a GitHub repository with complete Q# and Python code for your project and a write-up of your results, which includes a brief description of the algorithm/primitive you chose, the problem instances on which you verified the correctness of your solution, the resource estimates you obtained, and your analysis of the estimates.
#Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm resource estimation
We implemented Deutsch-Jozsa for resource estimation. This algorithm evaluates number of queries to the oracle. With help of this algorithm, it is possible to decide whether a function has certain peroperty with single call of the function, instead of two calls that are necessary classically. 

#Output of the algorithm
Function 0 is constant.
Function 1 is constant.
Function 2 is balanced.
Result: "()"
